        review: 'I had the opportunity to meet Michael through a mutual friend who knew I was looking to move into a more technical role. Upon meeting Michael, he was very warm, friendly, and dedicated. We had a resume review session and he was extremely helpful! He not only went over her comments and feedback but also gave me valuable advice on how to make changes. He spoke to me about what recruiters are looking for and how to make my resume stand out. He was able to answer my questions and give me constructive criticism which I greatly appreciate!'

        review: 'I had the pleasure of working with Michael for a brief time on a high-intensity project. Michael was hired strictly to back-fill an Author position using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) for an employee who departed with only a few days notice and little documentation. Not only did Michael figure out the (poorly maintained) system quickly, but we quickly learned his skills on Angular were of great service on other aspects of the project. Unfortunately, the project ended prematurely. Michael was no-drama, smart, and a great problem-solver. I fought to keep him, and I would happily work with him again.'

        review: 'Michael is an absolute pleasure to work with. He helped me with my existing website fixing a problem promptly, expertly, and graciously. He was able to diagnose a problem no one else seemed to understand, he took initiative, solved the problem, and had me up and running quickly. He\'s also a great communicator, and as a non-tech person I was able to understand all his explanations and instructions very easily. I am no longer afraid of web-based problems now that I have Michael\'s help. He is my new go-to-guy and I look forward to our continued relationship. I recommend Michael highly.'
